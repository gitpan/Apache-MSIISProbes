This is Apache::MSIISProbes

This module catches attempts by worms designed for
Microsoft IIS to infect an Apache server, and 
responds by sending mail to various people 
responsible for the host computer that launched the
attack.

The module is extensible and as new worms are created
the Apache server administrator can catch them by
simply adding a regexp matching the URI the worm is
attempting to exploit to the Apache configuration file.

The user can also control the number of e-mail messages
to be sent as well as the recipients.

The module also displays statistics on the number of
attacks on the Apache server.

Enjoy!
